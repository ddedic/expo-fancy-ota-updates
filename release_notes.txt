## Added
- `ota-publish revert` to roll back a channel to a previous update group.
- `ota-publish promote` to copy an update group between channels (`preview -> production`).
- Safe-by-default release management UX:
  - interactive group selection when no `--group` is provided
  - confirmation prompts by default
  - `--dry-run` previews
  - `--yes` bypass flag for automation
- `lastSkippedReason` in `useOTAUpdates()` context.
- `recordSkippedChecks` provider config option.

## Changed
- Skipped update checks now optionally update metadata (`lastCheck`) and expose reason consistently.
- `UpdateBanner` no longer requires `expo-linear-gradient`; it falls back to a solid `View` background automatically.
- Updated docs for revert/promote commands, skip metadata behavior, and gradient fallback behavior.
- Updated Photo Trim App Store link to `https://apps.apple.com/app/id6755884114`.
