## 1.5.0

### Runtime Channel Switching ("Channel Surfing")
- Added `switchChannel(channel)` to `useOTAUpdates()` hook — lets production apps switch which update channel they pull from at runtime.
- Uses Expo SDK 54's `Updates.setUpdateRequestHeadersOverride()` under the hood.
- Added `isSwitchingChannel` boolean state for tracking switch-in-progress.
- Added `SwitchChannelResult` type export for typed responses.
- Same guard pattern as `checkForUpdate`: skips gracefully in DEV mode, simulators, and when updates are disabled.
- Perfect for QA/stakeholders previewing staging or preview channel updates without rebuilding.

### Demo App
- Added "Channel surfing" section to the controls screen with interactive channel buttons (production/staging/preview).
- Shows current channel, loading state, and skip alerts in DEV mode.

### Docs & Cleanup
- Updated VitePress docs with channel switching API reference and examples.
- Fixed install commands across README and docs (were all showing `pnpm`).
- Fixed sidebar link in VitePress config (apps/ → examples/).
- Updated copyright year to 2025-2026.
- Updated SDK requirement to Expo SDK 54+.
- Removed completed items from "Planned" section in changelog.
