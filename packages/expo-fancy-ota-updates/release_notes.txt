## 1.4.1

### ✅ Fixed
- `OTAInfoScreen` now resolves `currentUpdateId` more reliably by checking both `Updates.updateId` and `Updates.manifest.id`.
- Update ID presentation in `OTAUpdateInfo` is clearer and more diagnostic:
  - available IDs show as compact `prefix...suffix`
  - development builds without exposed IDs now show `N/A (dev build)`
- Tab-hosted `OTAInfoScreen` no longer lets bottom content get hidden behind tab bars thanks to improved inset and bottom padding behavior.

### 🧭 Navigation Integration Notes
- When using `OTAInfoScreen` inside native stack/tab navigation, avoid rendering two headers at the same time.
- For tab routes, prefer a single visible header source:
  - native stack header OR
  - `OTAInfoScreen` internal header
- If you enable native tab-specific features (for example tab bar minimize behavior), gate them by platform/version and keep a fallback for older or unstable environments.
